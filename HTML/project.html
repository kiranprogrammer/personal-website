        <p>ABSTRACT</p>

        <marquee>This research pioneers an innovative methodology for the bespoke manufacturing of SquidSkin safety products, meticulously tailored to the distinct requisites of diverse industries encompassing medical, military, and defense sectors. The triple DES algorithm is a three instance of DES on same plain text in blocks of 64 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 168 bits. The triple DES encryption process creates ciphertext, which is an unreadable, effectively indecipherable conversion of plaintext data, the version of information that humans can read and understand. The output of the encryption process, the triple DES ciphertext, cannot be read until a secret triple DES key is used to decrypt it.The delineation of industry-specific manufacturing parameters mandates a nuanced approach to material composition and production processes, culminating in a paradigmatic advancement in safety product customization. Integral to this methodology is a rigorous analysis of industryspecific requirements, guiding the selection of optimal material compositions. This selection is underpinned by a meticulously designed material testing phase, ensuring adherence to exacting industry standards and performance benchmarks. Augmenting this paradigm is an imperative emphasis on fortifying the security framework underpinning the handling of proprietary manufacturing data. The proposal introduces an advanced cryptographic architecture, featuring encryption and decryption protocols. This security infrastructure not only safeguards the confidentiality of classified manufacturing intelligence but also fortifies the manufacturing process against unauthorized intrusion. This research paradigm not only signifies a breakthrough in SquidSkin safety product fabrication but also serves as a bespoke solution tailored to the idiosyncrasies of each industry domain.  </marquee>
